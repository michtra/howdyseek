# howdyseek
the #1 solution to getting the classes you need. created just in time for spring 2025 open registration.

howdyseek > all

# Description
This program uses Selenium to loop through your added courses on Aggie Schedule Builder and clicks on each one's information
regarding sections with available seats to notify you through a Discord webhook.

Firstly, it creates a tab for each course you want to track. Then it loops through each tab, refreshes to find the
number of seats, and notifies you accordingly.

## Notes
Originally I tried accessing just the page
links (https://tamu.collegescheduler.com/terms/Spring%202025%20-%20College%20Station/courses/...) but Schedule Builder
forces me to choose the term. I also tried accessing the course page after choosing the term, but Schedule Builder forces
a term selection again. Therefore, the term has to be selected on the initial page and there's no workaround.
